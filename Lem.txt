Not far from here,
by a white sun,
behind a green star,
lived the Steelypips,
illustrious,
industrious,
and they hadn't a care: no spats in their vats, no rules, no schools, no gloom,
no evil influence of the moon, no trouble from matter or antimatter-for
they had a machine,
a dream of a machine,
with springs
and
gears
and
perfect in every
respect.
